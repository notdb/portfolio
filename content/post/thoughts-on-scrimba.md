### What is Scrimba?

According to their website, Scrimba is a platform for learning to code. It's mostly focused on front-end development at the moment, but could easily be expanded upon in the future.

#### How does it work

Scrimba is essentially web IDE, similar to CodeSandbox, Repl.it, or CodePen. The main difference is that it also has a built in screencast. If you've ever tried to follow a YouTube tutorial for something programming related, you've probably had the experience where you're constantly stopping and starting the video to copy and paste (or rather type up) examples from the video. Scrimba removes that step. You get the screencast and IDE in one package. Whenever you pause the cast, you can start typing in the same window the instructor was writing their code in. What you type becomes a note on the cast (see picture below).

You see all your notes you've saved at the end of a section, and reference them for later if need be.

The neat part is the instructor can give you exercises in the same window you're following along with them. I'd say it makes following along with a tutorial a little more relaxing because you don't have to focus on stopping and starting the video along with no IDE fiddling around. Typically, with a lot of the web IDE/text editors, there isn't that much to fiddle around with to begin with, but Scrimba removes even a little bit more.

#### Final Thoughts

Overall, I think Scrimba is another additional step closer to having better online learning environments for programming basics in particular. The platform still seems to lack some things that I would appreciate coming from the student perspective.

The instructor still has a lot of leeway over how they're structuring their course. So, if you wouldn't enjoy the instructor on a YouTube video, you won't like them much on Scrimba either. 

Scrimba doesn't seem to have built in support for exercises yet. Whenever you get to a point in the tutorial where the instructor wants you to do something, they'll tell you what to do and then also tell you to pause the screencast. It's still very manual. 

From a learning perspective, you do get a lot of incremental "pause the screencast here and edit this code" type of exercises in each screencast. But, you only get one or two of them, and they don't really give you the ability to self-identify/diagnose areas where you're having trouble learning.

In contrast, I've noticed when working through math textbooks, it's typical to get many more exercises for problems than you'd ever need to do. In school, it was common to have homework assigned to only do problems 4-7, 12, 15, and 17 out of a section that say had 30-35 problems. Online programming tutorials, and most textbooks, don't really have numerous examples like that. When working a lot of math problems, you get a lot of repetition, and practice working with the new tool or piece of knowledge you learned from multiple different angles. 

For example, if you recently learned how addition works, you could expect the problem set to have you adding various kinds of numbers. Integers, decimals, multiple digit numbers, fractions, etc. For example:

1. 2 + 3
2.  .66 + 2
3. 1/5 + 2/5
4. 44 + 107

and so on. Most of the tutorials I've seen on Scrimba (and eleswhere) will give you one or two example problems, tell you to "mess around" for more practice, or have one or two additional problems to work on. 

The lack of extensive example problem sections is the one thing I don't like about Scrimba, but it's also not really in the core area of the product. Scrimba looks like it's positioning itself to be a marketplace where other people can upload their own courses that use the Scrimba platform (which is essentially a combined screencast + web IDE).

It's one step closer to better computer assisted learning, but the actual practice part leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion. Still worth using over your typical online course you'd find elsewhere (depending on who is teaching it).
