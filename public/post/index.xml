      <description>What is Scrimba? According to their website, Scrimba is a platform for learning to code. It&#39;s mostly focused on front-end development at the moment, but could easily be expanded upon in the future.
How does it work Scrimba is essentially web IDE, similar to CodeSandbox, Repl.it, or CodePen. The main difference is that it also has a built in screencast. If you&#39;ve ever tried to follow a YouTube tutorial for something programming related, you&#39;ve probably had the experience where you&#39;re constantly stopping and starting the video to copy and paste (or rather type up) examples from the video.</description>
